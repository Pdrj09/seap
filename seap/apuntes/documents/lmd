  </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  <td style="background-color: #F9F9F9;">(1) This file is a live tutorial. Simply by following along with the numbers in front of the text, you can learn to use all TreeSheets functionality quickly and easily!
    <table style="border-width: 2pt; font-size: 12pt;">
    <tr>
    <td style="font-weight: bold;">The basics
      <table style="border-width: 2pt; font-size: 11pt;">
      <tr>
      <td style="font-weight: normal;background-color: #FFFFFF;">(2) You found step 2! Good, now lets try inserting text. Each of these text boxes is called a "cell". See the empty cell between (2) and (3)? Click anywhere inside it to select it 
      </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
      <td style="font-weight: normal;background-color: #FFFFFF;">
      </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
      <td style="font-weight: normal;background-color: #FFFFFF;">(3) The cell above should be selected (have a thick black border around it). Now type something, and you see any text ends up in the selected cell. Notice how when you started typing, a cursor appeared, and the selection box became thinner. This signals the cell is in text edit mode, so things like cursor keys, delete etc, work on the current text. You can also double click to get into text edit mode, or press enter. To exit, press enter again, or press escape, or just select another cell.
      </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
      <td style="font-weight: normal;background-color: #FFFFFF;">(4) There is an even better way to insert text however. See the dotted lines between cells? These we call "grid lines". Select (click on) the grid line between (4) and (5)
      </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
      <td style="font-weight: normal;background-color: #FFFFFF;">(5) The line above here should be highlighted. Now start typing text again, and notice how a new cell automatically got inserted between (4) and (5). This also works on the borders of the cells. This is the natural way to extend any TreeSheet: find a location where you want to add information, and just start typing!
      </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
      <td style="font-weight: normal;background-color: #FFFFFF;">(6) You can also navigate across grid lines and cells without using the mouse, for even quicker editing: make sure this cell is selected, and then press cursor key UP and DOWN a few times.
      </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
      <td style="font-weight: normal;background-color: #FFFFFF;">(7) Deleting cells works in just the same way. Make sure you got any grid line above selected, and then press BACKSPACE to remove the cell above it (or before it), or press DELETE to remove the cell below it (or after it). This works analogous to how text editors and word processors work. Alternatively, simply selecting any cells (by clicking/dragging) and then pressing DELETE to remove all of them also works.
      </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
      <td style="font-weight: normal;background-color: #FFFFFF;">(8) If you have deleted a bunch of lines above (hopefully not this one!) now is a good time to try out undo! Press CTRL+Z repeatedly to bring your deletions back. TreeSheets has unlimited undo, so just holding down CTRL+Z for a while will restore the document back to its original state. CTRL+Y redoes.
        <table style="border-width: 2pt; font-size: 10pt;">
        <tr>
        <td>On OS X, wherever this tutorial refers to CTRL, use CMD instead. ALT is the same as the OPTION key.

      <tr>
      <td style="font-weight: normal;background-color: #FFFFFF;">(9) As you may have already noticed, TreeSheets can nest grids of cells. Each cell can contain its own grid. This cell for example has a sub grid.
        <table style="border-width: 2pt; font-size: 10pt;">
        <tr>
        <td style="font-family: monospace;background-color: #F9F9F0;color: #800000;">Tequila

      </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
      <td style="font-weight: normal;background-color: #FFFFFF;">(10) To add a grid to any cell, select the cell and press INSERT or SHIFT+ENTER. Try it on this cell, you should get a 1x1 grid below this text
      </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
      <td style="font-weight: normal;background-color: #FFFFFF;">(11) Try expanding the cell you made in (10) by selecting one of its 4 gridlines and typing text until you have at least a 3x3 grid. Also try moving around it with the cursor keys in all directions.
      </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
      <td style="font-weight: normal;background-color: #FFFFFF;">(12) Now let's try moving things around in grids. Select an entire column in a grid (such as the numbers in the grid contained in (9)) by dragging from the top cell in the row to the bottom. Much like in spreadsheets (and unlike some other applications), dragging in TreeSheets is for expanding a selection, not for moving. Now Press CTRL+LEFT cursor key or CTRL+RIGHT to shift the data around.
      </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
      <td style="font-weight: normal;background-color: #FFFFFF;">(13) You can copy cells, for example, select this one, copy with CTRL+C, then select any grid line above and press CTRL+V. If you select multiple cells, the selection will be inserted at the destination as multiple lines. Try it. Cutting (CTRL+X) or Deleting multiple cell selections works similarly intuitively. If inserting cells "inline" on a paste is undesirable, you can always create a new grid first, and then paste on that, to create hierarchy.
      </td>

    <tr>
    <td style="font-weight: bold;">Cell formatting &amp; Zoom
      <table style="border-width: 2pt; font-size: 11pt;">
      <tr>
      <td style="font-weight: normal;background-color: #FFFFFF;">(14) Text in a cell is akin to a single paragraph. It is split up in lines automatically depending on the column width of whatever column it is in. How wide the columns should be depends on how you prefer to structure your TreeSheet overall. You can see the column width in the status bar (for the column the mouse is over). Make sure this cell is selected, and then hold ALT and roll the mousewheel to see what happens (or ALT+PGUP/PGDN). This cell should be reformatted automatically, as well as other cells in this column, and any grids inside this column. Note that the column width specifies the maximum number of characters per line, so it won't make a grid wider once every cell is on a single line.
        <table style="border-width: 2pt; font-size: 10pt;">
        <tr>
        <td>On some Mac keyboards, PGUP/PGDN is emulated with FN+UP/DOWN. Also, the scrollwheel is instead a swipe on the trackpad (or magic mouse).
        </td>
        </tr>
        </table>
      </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
      <td style="font-weight: normal;background-color: #FFFFFF;">(15) A more powerful option to change the space a cell takes up on screen (good for indicating the relative importance of something) is to change the text size. Select this cell, hold SHIFT and roll the mousewheel (or SHIFT+PGUP/PGDN).
      </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
      <td style="font-weight: normal;background-color: #FFFFFF;">(16) Notice how if you keep making it smaller, eventually text will be rendered as individual pixels. This may seem useless, but is actually a neat way of information management that replaces folding/unfolding of hierarchies so prevalent in other applications.
      </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
      <td style="font-weight: normal;background-color: #FFFFFF;">(17) For example, this cell contains a tiny grid. Select this cell, then hold CTRL and roll the mouse wheel forward 3x to zoom into this cell (or CTRL+PGUP/PGDN).
        <table style="border-width: 2pt; font-size: 10pt;">
        <tr>
        <td>(18) You couldn't read this text before, but now you can!
        </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
        <td>(19) When you zoom in, TreeSheets sets the base text size to the average size of the top level grid shown. When you change the text size with SHIFT+scrollwheel, you change the relative size of text. That means it depends on the zoom level how big that text appears. This may sound complicated, but the net effect is that you can make text really small yet see more of it when you zoom in.
        </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
        <td>(20) The idea is that you use small sub grids like this one to store information (such as a todo list for a specific project) that you want to be available in your overal TreeSheet, but you don't want it to take up space. Reading or editing it is always just a flick of the mousewheel away.
        </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
        <td>(21) Also, setting text size is something you have to generally do only once, whereas tree folding/unfolding or scrolling as you end up doing in other applications is something you do every time you want to view the information. TreeSheets makes navigating large amounts of information less of a chore, and easier to overview (the pixel sized text still gives an impression of how much information is contained inside the cell, and the structure of it).
        </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
        <td>(22) To make this text readable at the top level again, select cells (18..23) (not 17), zoom out twice (mousewheel back), and then SHIFT+mousewheel forward until this becomes readable again.
        </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
        <td>(23) If you now want to make this smaller, select the same cells, and use SHIFT+mousewheel backward to reduce the size.
        </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
        <td>(24) Notice the greyed out text you see above the header text when you are zoomed in? This is called the context, and helps you remember what part of the treesheet you zoomed in to.
        </td>

        </table>
      </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
      <td style="font-weight: normal;background-color: #FFFFFF;">if instead you prefer to completely hide a grid out of sight, you can using folding (F10 on Windows, CTRL+F10 on other platforms). Try pressing it repeatedly on this cell to see the effect
        <table style="border-width: 2pt; font-size: 10pt;">
        <tr>
        <td>This cell and the ones below will be hidden!
        </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
        <td>notice that a cell that has a folded grid gains a '+' icon as its image, denoting that there is extra information that can be shown. If you unfold it, the image will automatically dissapear
        </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
        <td>cells will also automatically be unfolded if you use functions such as "search next" to jump between cells that are not currently visible.
        </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
        <td>Though folding may be a familiar operation you know from other applications, shrinking text to become tiny (see 17) will give you a better overview over your information, try it out!

From now on, you can set any other cell to a tag with CTRL+Right Mouse Button (popup menu). Tags are colored blue, to signal to you it is a tag. This helps spotting if a tag is mistyped.

      <td style="font-weight: normal;background-color: #FFFFFF;">The "Wrap in parent" (F9) operation is a great way to create new hierarchy. Make any selection of cells, and this operation will make those into a new grid, and a new parent that sits in the place of where the cells came from. For example, try selecting C &amp; D below, then press F9, and type something:
        <table style="border-width: 2pt; font-size: 10pt;">

      <td style="font-weight: normal;background-color: #FFFFFF;">Filters are a feature that is useful once your treesheets grow really big. They allow you to temporarily filter out a subset of the sheet to focus on the cells you're looking for. This works by forcing the cells that are filtered out to be displayed as 1-pixel text, and in light grey. Try out the filtering options in the view menu:
        <table style="border-width: 2pt; font-size: 10pt;">
        <tr>
        <td>Try entering "treesheets" as search query right now. some cells will look red. Now try setting the search filter (View -&gt; Filter -&gt; Show only cells in current search), all the sheet should shrink considerably, making it easier to see what you're looking for. Do this at the top level view of this sheet. Try zooming in and out with the filter on. Try editing the search query, the filter view will change as you type.
        </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
        <td>Try the "last 10% of edits" on this sheet, too. Make sure to turn the search query off, first.

Unlike traditional tools like powerpoint, which make it really difficult to convey a sense of structure to the audience, you can organize a treesheet as if your entire presentation was a single "slide", and have minimized sub-slides that you can zoom into. To help its use as a presentation tool, TreeSheets has two viewing options: Fullscreen View (F11) to reduce visual clutter, and Scaled View (F12) which tries to make the current view as large as possible.
        <table style="border-width: 2pt; font-size: 10pt;">

        <td>Note, both this feature and printing make use of a scaling method that does not preserve rendering fidelity in all cases. This will be fixed in a future version.
